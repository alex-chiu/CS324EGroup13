Assignment 3: Novel Visualization

In this project, we implemented the functionalities of:
a) A Python script (extract_words.py) that can parse a book and generate allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt and wordfrequency.txt.
b) A Processing script (a3_novelvisualization.pde) that can visualize the words found in allwords.txt. This includes displaying
random, colored words on the screen, and refreshing the words each time the user clicks a mouse button. The color scheme for the
background and words was chosen to reflect the whimsical, fantasy nature of the story, with bright, vivid colors. 
c) A Processing script (a3_wordfrequency.pde) that visualizes the frequency of different words appearing in the story. For this,
we closely followed the recommended display in the assignment page, with horizontal bars representing specific frequency. The 
largest bar at the bottom shows the large number of words that only appear once, while the narrow upper part reflects how 
only a few words are repeated very often.

Group Responsibilities:
Albert and Amar implemented the extract_words.py and a3_wordfrequency.pde scripts. 
Alex completed the a3_novelvisualization.pde code, and finished off the project with the required documentation.
