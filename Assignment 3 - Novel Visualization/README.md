# Assignment 3: Novel Visualization

1. Run the extract_words.py script to generate all the text files. This script breaks down a book (in our case, The Chronicles of Alice) into allwords.txt, uniquewords.txt and wordfrequency.txt.
2. Then, to generate the word cloud based on allwords.txt, move the allwords.txt file into the a3_novelvisualization Processing folder (this has already been done for our code).
3. Open a3_novelvisualization.pde and click the run button. It should display a 700x600 window with all the features specified in the assignment.
4. Then, move the wordfrequency.txt file into the a3_wordfrequency folder (this is also done in our submission).
5. Finally, open a3_wordfrequency.pde and click the run button to display a visualization of the frequency words appeared in the book.
