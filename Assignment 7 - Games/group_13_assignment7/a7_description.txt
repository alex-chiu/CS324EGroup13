Game Functionality:
A Space Invaders-esque game, where a player must control a spaceship to defeat aliens before they can reach Earth.

Rules of Play:
1) Aliens move from the top of the screen downward, and shoot projectiles directly down as well.
2) The player can move in 4 directions (up, down, left, right) and shoot laser back at the aliens.
3) The player can clear a level by defeating all aliens.
4) The aliens speed up with each level.
5) The player loses a life if hit by an alien or alien laser.

Win/Lose Conditions:

Win:
The player wins if they are able to defeat 5 levels of aliens, each of which moves faster and is more difficult than the last.

The player loses if they lose all 3 lives (from being hit by aliens/lasers) or if an alien manages to reach Earth.
