Enemy And Enemy Bullet Collision With Player
- right now when the player collides with an enemy or an enemy bullet, the player's x-position is moved to -50

Cheap Bullet Strategy
- the player is able to move with the bullet and can touch the enemies with the bullet without ever firing it with spacebar
- quick fix: maybe a boolean isActive (bullet's y-position is certain distance away from player y-position) when firing the bullet and collision only takes place when    isActive is true

Pause Functionality?
- setting all movespeeds to 0
- disable all keys except for P or mouseclick to continue
