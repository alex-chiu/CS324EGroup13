Assignment 5: 3D Animation

In this project, we implemented the functionalities of:
a) A 3D scene drawn via Processing that continously animates.
b) Multiple objects with different hierarchical groupings.

More specifically:
A person object that moves back and forth across the screen.
A snowman object that does the same.
Snowball and colored disc objects that move across the screen and switch directions when encountering
the edge. The colored disc also rotates at a given angular velocity.
A camera that rotates according to mouse position. If the mouse is in the left third of the screen, the
camera rotates to the left while staying centered on the origin of the scene. It rotates to the right if
the mouse is in the right third, and stays still if it is in the center third.
A static, transparent box to serve as a reference frame (given the rotating camera).
An IronMan.obj object.

Group Responsibilities:
Albert and Amar worked on the snowman, person, and snowball objects. They drew and animated each of these.
Alex completed the disc, the Iron Man object, and the camera rotation functionality.
