Assignment 4: 2D Animation

In this project, we implemented the functionalities of:
a) A 2D scene drawn via Processing that continously animates.
b) Multiple objects with different hierarchical groupings.

More specifically:
The ship travels from the left of the screen to the right, and the waves and flags move along with it.
The cannonballs fire once the ship reaches the halfway point, with a sound playing.
The clouds travel from right to left, with the rain falling from each cloud.
The sun and moon move in an arc across the sky, and change the background of the screen depending on
if it is daytime or nighttime. 

Group Responsibilities:
Albert primarily drew and animated the ship, flags, waves, and cannonballs.
Amar worked on the clouds and rain.
Alex drew and animated the sun and moon, and integrated all the different objects into the final 
pde file.
