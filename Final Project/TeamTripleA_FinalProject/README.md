# Final Project: Galactic Invaders

1. Our final project, Galactic Invaders, is a Space Invaders-esque arcade game.
2. Open the TeamTripleA_FinalProject.pde file.
3. If you don't have it yet, you might have to install a sound extension known as Minim. You can
   do so by going to Sketch > Import Library > Add Library and searching up "Minim." We chose to
   use this sound library due to its ability to handle multiple sounds at once.
4. Press the play button at the top of the Processing window to being the game.
5. The controls for the game are as follows:
   - WASD for directional movement
   - Space Bar for shooting your laser
6. The game consists of endless waves of enemies, so defeat as many as you can to obtain a high score!
7. You will get a shield that protects you from one enemy every 3 levels.
